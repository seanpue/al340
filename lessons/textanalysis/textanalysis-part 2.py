# ## Welcome!
# This is an IPython Notebook. It contains numerous cells that can be of different types (Markdown, Code, Headings). This is lesson two. You may need to [install the Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) to begin.
# 
# #### Your turn
# 
# Select the cell above this one by double clicking it with your mouse.
# 
# You can see that it contains text in a format called Markdown. To execute the cell,
# press `shift+enter.` To complete this tutorial (which is meant for a classroom), execute the cells and follow the instructions.

# ## What is NTLK?
# 
# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a software for doing natural language processing (NLP). It has quite a number of features, and it is easy to learn.
# 
# We will just work with a few features in this lesson in order to learn some of the possibilities
# for computational analysis of text.
