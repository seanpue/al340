For students enrolled in the class I have sent the following notification regarding anonymity:

> If any of you are in a position where you would prefer to or must maintain your anonymity, please feel free to use a pseudoname for your public profiles, including Twitter and Github accounts.

>While digital humanities focuses very strongly on publicness and openness, your safety, security, and comfort in the class are a priority.

I was reminded yesterday of the importance of including a statement like that. While I stated something verbally to that effect in class, I wanted to also include it in writing.  I have also added this text to the course guidelines.

Comments are welcome for better phrasing. We will discuss that in class on Friday, and I will post any amendments.
