    * This is a test Ranti Junus did for our library e-resources page with my blind student. The purpose of this video is to show the mental model used by those with visual impairment when constructing how the page is organized, compare to the sighted users.
  * Ranti Junus, ["Tools I use when performing accessibility assessment"](
http://blog.rantijunus.net/2014/02/02/tools-i-use-when-performing-accessibility-assessment/)

  * [How People with Disabilities Use the Web: Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview)
  * [Considering the User Perspective: A Summary of Design Issues](http://webaim.org/articles/userperspective/)
  * [Designing for Screen Reader Compatibility](http://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/)
* Before class install Python on your computer, either Anaconda or Enthought Canopy. [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is probably the easiest distribution to install. This may take some time. Python is also available on the lab computers. Also install [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html).
* Before class read:
    * [Quantitative Analysis and Literary Studies](http://digitalhumanities.org:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-9&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-9&brand=9781405148641_brand)
